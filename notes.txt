need k-fold validation
different achitectures could be examined (name them)
SGD loss function?
are labels kind of bad?
should I eliminate some of the other classes?
data augmentation made things much worse, probably did something wrong
LR decay good enough?
More epochs?
More examples
would be good to fix the missing edge of all frames
